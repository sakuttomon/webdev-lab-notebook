### HTML - 01

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, using the video solutions as review after I finished for comparison. The exception to this was the 03-table exercise, where I got by the formatting and combination of `<tr>` and `<td>` to match the requested table design. Watching the video for assistance helped me get back on track and where specifically the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes mattered.

I found the exercises especially helpful because of how varied they were; practicing different types of HTML tags in each exercise felt like we were establishing a wide foundation of what native HTML has to offer. The 04-form exercise was particularly helpful because it also shows how to manage groups of HTML within groups (e.g. the inner fieldset within the form), leading to better practices on nesting HTML.

Although the `<fieldset>` tag was covered in the reading assignments, I wish it was expanded upon in the slides since I was initially puzzled on what to do in the 04-form exercise until it occurred to me from reviewing the web.dev docs. Overall, I think the HTML exercises encompass a reasonable and satisfactory area of content, so I don’t have any suggestions on additional exercises that would help us learn HTML better.

### Accessibility - 02

I was able to complete the exercise on my own, other than the `<button>` tags needing to change to the more semantic `<input>` from watching the video to compare solutions. I appreciated how the exercise emphasized the difference between explicit and implicit labeling, and even though I used the former as it’s more preferred, I understand the reasoning behind both cases. I also like how the exercise enforced that the developer must ensure that only one radio input was selectable by using the same `name` attribute for all the inputs within the Favorite Character fieldset. This lesson emphasizes the standard of one selected radio button per group and the purpose of the `name` attribute in general.

I wish using the `<input>` over the provided `<button>` was explained better, as `<button>` still seems semantically sufficient. Since the exercise is about a form, perhaps an explanation on the importance of `<input>` throughout the entire form, including its submission functionality, would elaborate on why `<button>` is not the best choice to use in a form. Since there was only one exercise for this section, I do wish we had some more exercises to practice adding accessibility to HTML elements other than forms. Because the lectures covered the topics of color contrast and ARIA labels, some exercises to especially practice the former, since color design is essential in web development, would have helped learn more accessibility practices.
