### HTML - 01

Prior to the reading assignments and exercises, I really only knew about the unsemantic elements and basic text tags like `<p>`. The plenty of semantic tags, especially the existence of variants meant for use in specific circumstances (e.g. `<article>`, `<aside>`, and the general `<section>`) astonished me. In my previous experience, most of my HTML elements were `<div>` tags with custom classes to style with full freedom. Although I believe such customization is still useful and practical, after learning about semantic HTML, wrapping said `<div>` within a more descriptive HTML tag to provide context and meaning is essential.

As a beginning learner, I appreciate the many native HTML tags that provide semantic meaning and a "base" design that developers can use for prototyping or proof of concepts. For example, the `<fieldset>` applied to the 04-form exericise served as a simple method to group form inputs together, including header support in the form of the `<legend>` tag. Before reading about these tags, I thought I needed to implement some custom border to replicate the box group in that exercise. However, I presume as websites get more complex, engineers would create custom components that semantically describe their function. Under the hood there would still exist native HTML, but custom components allows us to name our own semantics so that it relates to the product.
