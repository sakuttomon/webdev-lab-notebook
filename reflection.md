## Reflection Document

### HTML - 01

I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own, using the video solutions as review after I finished for comparison. The exception to this was the 03-table exercise, where I got by the formatting and combination of `<tr>` and `<td>` to match the requested table design. Watching the video for assistance helped me get back on track and where specifically the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes mattered.

I found the exercises especially helpful because of how varied they were; practicing different types of HTML tags in each exercise felt like we were establishing a wide foundation of what native HTML has to offer. The 04-form exercise was particularly helpful because it also shows how to manage groups of HTML within groups (e.g. the inner fieldset within the form), leading to better practices on nesting HTML.

Although the `<fieldset>` tag was covered in the reading assignments, I wish it was expanded upon in the slides since I was initially puzzled on what to do in the 04-form exercise until it occurred to me from reviewing the web.dev docs. Overall, I think the HTML exercises encompass a reasonable and satisfactory area of content, so I don’t have any suggestions on additional exercises that would help us learn HTML better.

### Accessibility - 02

I was able to complete the exercise on my own, other than the `<button>` tags needing to change to the more semantic `<input>` from watching the video to compare solutions. I appreciated how the exercise emphasized the difference between explicit and implicit labeling, and even though I used the former as it’s more preferred, I understand the reasoning behind both cases. I also like how the exercise enforced that the developer must ensure that only one radio input was selectable by using the same `name` attribute for all the inputs within the Favorite Character fieldset. This lesson emphasizes the standard of one selected radio button per group and the purpose of the `name` attribute in general.

I wish using the `<input>` over the provided `<button>` was explained better, as `<button>` still seems semantically sufficient. Since the exercise is about a form, perhaps an explanation on the importance of `<input>` throughout the entire form, including its submission functionality, would elaborate on why `<button>` is not the best choice to use in a form. Since there was only one exercise for this section, I do wish we had some more exercises to practice adding accessibility to HTML elements other than forms. Because the lectures covered the topics of color contrast and ARIA labels, some exercises to especially practice the former, since color design is essential in web development, would have helped learn more accessibility practices.

### CSS - 03

Besides reviewing the videos after an exercise for revision, I completed the earlier numbered exercises on my own, but I resorted to the video solutions on _05-Position_ and _06-Media-Queries_ mostly for assistance on specific padding and margin values. I enjoyed how the exercises explored the vast array of CSS syntax and key concepts all in relatively isolated forms. For example, I like how the _05-Position_ exercise practices the common position types through individual classes but all on one page, allowing us to thoroughly analyze the differences between each type. With how essential responsive design and cross-device functionality is in the industry, I appreciated the _06-Media-Queries_ exercise that applied the three common viewport sizes through simplistic color swapping. The fact that we also had to manage a navigation bar with these media queries made the exercise feel more like a realistic application that greatly improves understanding.

On the contrary, despite the 6th exercise arguably being the most useful, going through the exercise was initially confusing due to its increased complexity compared to the prior exercises. I had not realized the browser stylesheet was enforcing defaults on specific properties, like text decorations, that we needed to override until hinted by the video solution. The navigation bar also gets a little convoluted with the specific paddings and margins used to satisfy the screenshot. Overall, I believe we got a good grasp on many CSS essentials that were applied in semi-realistic scenarios. To cover every core concept from the lectures, there could perhaps be another exercise to practice the different typographies/fonts and color modification to make a web page visually accessible.
